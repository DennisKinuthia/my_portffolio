My Developer Portfolio

## Software Development Stack

This project was built using Flutter for the web. It is a detailed portfolio of my journey as a software developer. I started my journey back in 2016 with Java SE and Microsfot VisualBasic.net. I then moved to Android application development in 2017. I learnt web development using javascript, HTML, CSS and pythom in 2018 and run with it until i discovered Flutter and fell in love with its elegance, cross-platfrom nature and powerful UI rendering.

All in all the road thus far has not been easy but I trust in God and His plan for my life. I continue to soldier on forward as long as I have breathe in my body.

PS: This repo is public. If you like the portfolio feel free to clone the repo and reason about the code yourself. In case you need clarification on any part of the project feel free to reach out to me through `denny.muasa@gmail.com`
