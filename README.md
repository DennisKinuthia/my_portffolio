## Previously on Dennis The Dev
It is a detailed portfolio of my journey as a software developer. I started my journey back in 2016 with Java SE and Microsfot VisualBasic.net. I then moved to Android application development in 2017. I learnt web development using javascript, HTML, CSS and pythom in 2018 and run with it until i discovered Flutter and fell in love with its elegance, cross-platfrom nature and powerful UI rendering.

All in all the road thus far has not been easy but I trust in God and His plan for my life. I continue to soldier on forward as long as I have breathe in my body.
